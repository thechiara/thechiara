TODO

# on elf 

rewrite 

# on chiaracore 

write the memory support 

the fpu is now supported except in alpha dec 

need to test 

road to meomorys upport and condition and internal processor instruction (like conditional jump, interrupts etc etc )


paging ok  for x86

but not for arm and ppc 

I will priorise the paging for ppc not for arm because tehe imple for arm is boring 

And start the imple of interrupt (is will more easy than paging)

write the support of basic alu bizarre risc instruction such as multiply and subsbtract (yes it exists !) 


# on all architectures 

reread the basic intepretation that support by chiara on it 

especially, arm target because Elliot thinks there are a lot of bizarre things on it  





# on ppc,arm and riscv 

implemente instruction like multiply and substract / addition /divide etc etc 

because I think they can be considered as basic ALU instructions because is recurent on risc architectures 




# and ...


Test test test thechiara to discover new bugs 

write program , compile it run it and see what append !
